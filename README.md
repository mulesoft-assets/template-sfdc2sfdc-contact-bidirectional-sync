# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
As a Salesforce admin I want to have my Contacts syncronized between two different Salesforce orgs.

This Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online bi-directional sync of Contacts between two SalesForce instances, being able to specify filtering criterias. 

The integration main behaviour is polling for changes (new Contacts or modified ones) that have occured in any of the Salesforces instances during a certain defined period of time. For those Contacts that both have not been updated yet the integration triggers an upsert (update or create depending the case) taking the last modification as the one that should be applied.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to stablish starting point to adapt the integration to any given requirements.

# Considerations <a name="considerations"/>

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**



## Salesforce Considerations <a name="salesforceconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding Salesforce, in order for this template to work.

In order to have this template working as expected, you should be aware of your own Salesforce field configuration.

###FAQ

 - Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one?

### As source of data

If the user configured in the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then a *InvalidFieldFault* API fault will show up.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault [ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='
Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. Please reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

### As destination of data

There are no particular considerations for this Anypoint Template regarding Salesforce as data destination.




# Run it! <a name="runit"/>
Simple steps to get Salesforce to Salesforce Contact Bidirectional Sync running.
See below.

## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.

After this,  the integration will fetch the updates occured since the date configured in the watermark.default.expression property.


### Where to Download Mule Studio and Mule ESB
First thing to know if you are a newcomer to Mule is where to get the tools.

+ You can download Mule Studio from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio)
+ You can download Mule ESB from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)


### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance: 

+ Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)
+ Anypoint Studio Project from External Location
+ Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml
+ Mule ESB Configuration XML from External Location

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).


### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`


### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
In order to [create your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) you should to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdc2sfdc-bidirectional-contact-sync` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sfdc2sfdc-bidirectional-contact-sync.cloudhub.io/synccontacts` and report will be sent to the emails configured.


### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)


## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>
In order to use this Mule Anypoint Template you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables. Detail list with examples:
### Application configuration
**Application configuration**
+ account.sync.policy `syncAccount`  
This defines the policy for Account syncing between both Salesforce instances. It can be set as assignDummyAccount ir syncAccount. The first one will use the account ID's set in the "account.id.in" properties.

+ polling.frequency `10000`  
This are the miliseconds that will run between two different checks for updates in Salesforce

+ watermark.default.expression `2014-02-25T11:00:00.000Z`  
This property is an important one, as it configures what should be the start point of the synchronization. If the use case includes synchronizing every contact created from the begining of the times, you should use a date previous to any contact creation (perhaphs `1900-01-01T08:00:00.000Z` is a good choice). If you want to synchronize the contacts created from now on, then you should use a default value according to that requirement (for example, today is Febraury 25th of 2014 and it's eleven o'clock, then I would take the following value `2014-02-25T11:00:00.000Z`).

**SalesForce Connector configuration for company A**
+ sfdc.a.username `bob.dylan@orga`
+ sfdc.a.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`
+ sfdc.a.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/26.0`
+ sfdc.a.integration.user.id `A0ed000BO9T`
+ account.id.in.a `0032001201ATHlvAAH`

**SalesForce Connector configuration for company B**
+ sfdc.b.username `joan.baez@orgb`
+ sfdc.b.password `JoanBaez456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`
+ sfdc.b.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/26.0`
+ sfdc.b.integration.user.id `B0ed000BO9T`  
+ account.id.in.b `0032001201ATHlvAAH`

**Some points to consider about configuration properties**

Polling Frecuency is expressed in miliseconds (different time units can be used) and the Watermark Default Expression defines the date to be used to query the first time the integration runs. [More details about polling and watermarking.](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Poll+Reference)

The date format accepted in SFDC Query Language is either YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm or you can use Constants (Like YESTERDAY in the example). [More information about Dates in SFDC.](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/officetoolkit/Content/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_dateformats.htm)

The query fields list must include both 'Email' and 'LastModifiedDate' fields, as those fields are embedded in the integration business logic

# API Calls <a name="apicalls"/>
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Contacts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Contacts are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).


# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by a batch job that will be responsible for creations/updates. The severeal message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:

1. Job execution is invoked from triggerFlow (endpoints.xml) everytime there is a new query executed asking for created/updated Contacts.
2. During the Process stage, each SFDC contact will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching contact in the opposite Salesforce instace and vise versa.
3. The last step of the Process stage will group the contacts and create/update them in Salesforce.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will logoutput statistics data into the console.



## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
It is intented to define the application API.



## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
This is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions. 
This file holds a [Choice Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Choice+Exception+Strategy) that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
